1. Set up a new laravel project in the repo
2. Create models and migrations to create database
3. Setup a controller to handle the payload, (bonus points for making it able to save data as separate attributes from the form one at a time and returning model ID in JSON response)
4. Make sure each array of data links to parent models correctly


Payload is in the payload.json file in the root of the repo
